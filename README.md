# QRgenerator
QR code generator - personal project.

In this project I've used the following Swift frameworks:

- UIKit
- CoreData

Features worth to mention:
- Activity View Controller used for sharing images;
- Keyboard will show/hide observers;
- QR code is generated using CIFilter + CIContext and scaled for better quality using CGAffineTransform.
